# Student-Management-System

🎓 Student Management System (CLI-Based)                 
This is a Python-based Command Line Interface (CLI) Student Management System that allows you to manage students, courses, enrollment, and grades. It's designed as a simple yet functional system for practicing object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python.

📌 Features                      
➕ Add student records (name, roll number, department)

📚 Add new courses (code, name, credits)

🧾 Enroll students in courses

📝 Assign grades to enrolled students

👤 Display individual student records with enrolled courses and grades

📋 List all students and all available courses

🧰 Technologies Used                                      
Python 3.x

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

CLI-based interface using input() and print()

🧪 How It Works                                 
The system uses:

A dictionary to store student details, keyed by roll number.

A list to store course information.

Embedded functions to add, update, and retrieve data interactively.

🚀 Getting Started                                    
Clone the repository or copy the Python code to your local environment.

Run the script:
python student_management_system.py
Follow the CLI menu to:

Add students or courses

Enroll students in courses

Assign grades

Display records

🧾 Example Use Case                              

1. Add Student
2. Add Course
3. Enroll Student in Course
4. Assign Grade
5. Display Student Record
6. List All Students
7. List All Courses
8. Exit
   
✅ Add a student:                        
➡️ Enter name, roll number, and department.

✅ Add a course:                         
➡️ Provide course code, name, and credit value.

✅ Enroll student:                          
➡️ Use roll number and course code to register a student.

✅ Assign grade:                     
➡️ Enter a grade for a student’s course enrollment.

✅ View student details:                         
➡️ See their department, courses, and assigned grades.

🛡 Limitations & Assumptions                                
No persistent storage (data is lost after the program exits).

Course codes and roll numbers must be unique.

Grades are manually entered as strings.
